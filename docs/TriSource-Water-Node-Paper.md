## Abstract

_This section will summarize the concept, system components, integrated feedback loops, energy/water efficiency, and the rationale for pilot and investment._

---

## 1. Introduction

- Global water insecurity
- Limitations of current desalination/AWG models

---

## 2. System Overview

- High-level diagram
- Core modules: HydroLens‚Ñ¢, MSSC Node‚Ñ¢, SPMD Desalination
- Synergistic feedback loops

---

## 3. Subsystem Design

### 3.1 Atmospheric Water Generation (HydroLens‚Ñ¢)

- üìç Off-grid clinic with agriculture overlay
- Key considerations: materials, cultural compatibility, energy yield

---

## 7. Capital Cost & ROI Modeling

- Estimated unit cost: $45‚Äì55k
- Water cost/liter over 10 years
- Payback vs. diesel delivery or bottled water in remote regions
- Economic triggers for scaling

---

## 8. Risk Analysis & Failure Modes

- Biofouling
