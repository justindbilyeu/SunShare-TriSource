## 🔱 Core Projects

### 🌊 [Tri-Source Water Node™](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/SunShare-TriSource/wiki/Tri-Source-Water-Node)
A decentralized, solar-powered system integrating:
- Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH)
- Microbial greywater cycling (MSSC Node)
- Solar desalination and brine reuse

Built for arid regions and climate resilience, it closes the loop between sunlight, saltwater, and life.

### 🏡 [SunShare HomeNode™](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/SunShare-TriSource/wiki/SunShare-Home-Node2.0)
A compact, garage-sized regenerative water system for American homes:
- Salt-based and salt-free softening
- AI-managed water-energy load balancing
- Passive solar heating and nitrate remediation
- Smart greywater reuse and microbial soil enrichment

HomeNode turns every house into a miniature water treatment and nutrient cycling facility—off-grid ready.

### 🧫 [MSSC Node™ – Microbial Enrichment System for Soil](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/SunShare-Connect-Initiative-/wiki/SunShare-MSSC-Node%E2%84%A2)
Our foundational microbial biome engine:
- Cultivated from waste streams, pond edges, compost piles, and native soils
- Housed in sump-style reactors with continuous aeration and flow
- Outputs nutrient-rich, living water that regenerates soil life and filters contaminants
