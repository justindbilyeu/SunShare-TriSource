# 💧 SunShare-TriSource™

**Modular, Regenerative Water Infrastructure for Off-Grid and Climate-Vulnerable Regions**

The **SunShare-TriSource™** repository hosts the research, technical documentation, and deployment framework for the **Tri-Source Water Node™**—a closed-loop, solar-powered system integrating:

- **Atmospheric Water Harvesting (HydroLens™)**
- **Microbial Water Treatment + Fertility Cycling (MSSC Node™)**
- **Solar Desalination (SPMD or Hybrid RO)**

Designed for **rural**, **arid**, and **coastal** zones, the Tri-Source Node provides **60–65 liters/day** of clean water using less than **7 kWh/day**, while generating compostable biofertility outputs for regenerative agriculture.

🌱 A Regenerative Infrastructure Project

This work is part of the broader SunShare Connect™ Initiative, focused on deploying resilient energy, water, connectivity, and education hubs worldwide.

Let’s build it as if the world depends on it—because it does.

Let me know when you're ready for the **pitch deck companion**, **stakeholder cover letter**, or **deployment pilot brief**.
