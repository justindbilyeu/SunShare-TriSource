# 💧 SunShare–TriSource™

**Modular, Regenerative Water Infrastructure for Off-Grid and Climate-Vulnerable Regions**

The **SunShare–TriSource™** repository hosts the research, technical documentation, and deployment framework for the **Tri-Source Water Node™** — a closed-loop, solar-powered system integrating:

- **Atmospheric Water Harvesting (HydroLens™)**
- **Microbial Enrichment for Soil (MSSC Node™)**
- **Solar Desalination (SPMD or Hybrid RO)**

Designed for **rural**, **arid**, and **coastal** zones, the Tri-Source Node delivers **60–65 liters/day** of clean water using **< 7 kWh/day** — while producing bio-nutrient outputs for regenerative agriculture.
